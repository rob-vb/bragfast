## 2026-04-30 — Session 0 — Planning + audit

**Attempted:**
- Read PRD.md end-to-end.
- Verified `compound-engineering` and `frontend-design` skills present in registry.
- Audited codebase A–L per orchestration spec (delegated to Explore subagent).
- Persisted gap analysis to `docs/audit.md`.
- Decomposed PRD §14 into 11 phases / ~40 sessions in `docs/sessions.md`.
- Initialized `docs/log.md` (this file) and `docs/decisions.md`.

**Verified by agent-browser:** N/A — planning session, no UI changes.

**Deferred / why:** No code work in Session 0 by orchestration design.

**Open questions for user:**
- Q1: Stripe price-ID strategy (re-map metadata vs new prices) — needed before S2.7.
- Q2: Video semantics in posts/month (1 video = 1 post on Buffet only?) — needed before S2.7 / S4.1.
- Q3: Kitchen disposition — fully demote (footer-only) vs keep at `/admin/kitchen` reachable but not in main nav.
- Q4: Clipboard destination — record `draftPushes` row with `provider: 'clipboard'` (analytics) vs skip table.
- Q5: Feature-flag granularity — single `LAUNCH_MODE` env vs per-feature flags.

**Next session start:** Await user approval of audit + plan. Then S0.1 (launch branch + flag scaffold).
